Inheritance:

Inheritance is one of the OOPS concepts, where a parent class's attributes and methods are
inherited by one or more child or derived(sub) classes. The parent class should be one and the child classes can be many.

Polymorphism:

Polymorphism is also one of the OOPS concepts, where a single method is used in many forms.

Method Overriding:

The Inheritance concept of OOPS is used in the case of Method overriding. For a method to be overridden,
we need to have one or more Subclasses which inherits and overrides the method of the parent class. Overriding means changing the functionality of the method. As the functionality is affected during the execution of the program it is also called as "runtime polymorphism".(Dynamic polymorphism).

Method Overloading:

The Method overloading is changing the argument type, no.of arguments and the sequence in which the argument is passed.
The difference in the return type is not considered as the method overloading.
As the the method overloading mostly deals with the variables, it is also called as the static polymorphism (compile time polymorphism).
